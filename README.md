# CS186 Project6: NoSQL

This repo contains my implementation for CS186 project6: NoSQL. You can find the project specification [here](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/CS186/blob/master/project-handout/proj6/getting-started.md) and [here](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/CS186/blob/master/project-handout/proj6/your-tasks.md). The dataset it uses is in the data.zip, you need to unzip it under this directory.
